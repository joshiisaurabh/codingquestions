1)Limit size of MongoDb document?
ans: 16Mb


2)Types of collections in mongodb?
Ans:
a)General Purpose Collections:
Description: Standard collections used for storing documents with varying structures.
Example: Storing user data in a collection named "users":

{
  "_id": ObjectId("609f9ec306af8f3e8f5aee3d"),
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
b)Capped Collections:
Description: Fixed-size collections with a maximum size limit, suitable for maintaining a circular buffer of recent data.
Example: Creating a capped collection named "logs" with a maximum size of 100MB:

db.createCollection("logs", { capped: true, size: 100 * 1024 * 1024 });

c)GridFS Collections:
Description: Collections used for storing and retrieving large files, exceeding the BSON document size limit of 16MB.
Example: Storing a large file in GridFS:

// Insert file metadata into "fs.files" collection
const fileId = db.fs.files.insertOne({ filename: "large_file.txt" }).insertedId;
// Insert file data into "fs.chunks" collection in chunks
db.fs.chunks.insertMany(chunks);
d)System Collections:
Description: Collections managed internally by MongoDB to store metadata and configuration information.
Example: Common system collections include "system.namespaces", "system.indexes", and "system.profile", used for storing namespace information, index definitions, and profiling data, respectively.
These examples provide a succinct overview of the different types of collections in MongoDB and their typical use cases.
