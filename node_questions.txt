1)Error handler and global error handler?
ans:
Both the error handler middleware and the global error handler serve different purposes. The error handler middleware is focused on handling errors that occur during the request processing flow, allowing you to customize the error response for the specific request. On the other hand, the global error handler is used to catch unhandled exceptions or rejections that may occur outside the regular request flow, providing a centralized mechanism to handle such errors.

To implement a global error handler in Node.js, you can attach event listeners to the uncaughtException and unhandledRejection events of the process object. Here's an example of how you can set up a global error handler in Node.js:

process.on('uncaughtException', function(err) {
  // Custom error handling logic
  console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
  process.exit(1);
});

process.on('unhandledRejection', function(reason, promise) {
  // Custom error handling logic
  console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', reason);
  process.exit(1);
});

2)Multicore process do they use the same port?
Ans:
No, in Node.js (or any other programming language/framework), you cannot bind multiple processes to the same port. When using a multicore system, each process or worker should listen on a different port.

In the example provided in the previous response, each worker process was set to listen on port 3000. This is possible because each worker process is running as a separate instance, utilizing a different CPU core. The load balancer or network infrastructure in front of your Node.js application can distribute incoming requests across these worker processes using techniques like round-robin or other load balancing algorithms.

By spreading the workload across multiple ports and worker processes, you can achieve parallel processing and take advantage of the multicore system's capabilities. However, it is essential to ensure that the load balancer or proxy in front of your Node.js application is properly configured to distribute the traffic to the available worker processes.


3)What is cluster module?
ans:
The Cluster module is built-in to Node.js and allows you to create multiple child processes (workers) that share the same server port. Each child process runs on a separate core of the CPU, enabling your application to take advantage of multi-core systems and handle incoming requests concurrently.
The Cluster module is typically used for load balancing and improving the performance of Node.js applications that serve a large number of client requests. It enables you to distribute the workload across multiple processes and make efficient use of available CPU resources.



// app.js

const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers equal to the number of CPU cores
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  // Each worker will start its own HTTP server
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('Hello, I am a worker!');
  }).listen(8000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}

4)What are threads in nodejs?
ans:
The Worker Threads module is a built-in module introduced in Node.js version 10.5.0. It allows you to create additional threads (isolated JavaScript contexts) within a single Node.js process. Each thread runs independently, and you can use them to perform parallel computations or intensive tasks without blocking the main thread.
The Worker Threads module is useful when you have CPU-intensive tasks that could benefit from parallel processing without affecting the responsiveness of the main event loop. It enables your application to utilize multiple CPU cores effectively for computationally expensive operations.

Example of using the Worker Threads module for parallel processing:

// app.js

const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  console.log(`Main thread ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Create a new worker thread
  const worker = new Worker(__filename);

  // Receive messages from the worker thread
  worker.on('message', message => {
    console.log(`Received from worker: ${message}`);
  });

  // Send a message to the worker thread
  worker.postMessage('Hello from the main thread!');
} else {
  console.log(`Worker thread ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Receive messages from the main thread
  parentPort.on('message', message => {
    console.log(`Received from main thread: ${message}`);

    // Send a message back to the main thread
    parentPort.postMessage('Hello from the worker thread!');
  });
}


5)Process vs threads:
ans:
Threads:



Threads are lightweight units of execution within a process.

Multiple threads can exist within a single process and share the same memory space.

Threads allow for concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single program.

In Node.js, JavaScript code runs on a single thread by default, often referred to as the "main" or "event loop" thread.

Node.js provides the worker_threads module to create and manage additional threads, enabling parallel execution of JavaScript code.

Worker threads can be used for CPU-intensive tasks or when you want to perform operations concurrently to leverage multiple CPU cores efficiently.

Processes:



Processes, on the other hand, are independent instances of a program that run in their own memory space.

Each process has its own memory and resources, including its own instance of the Node.js runtime.

Processes are isolated from each other and communicate via inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.

In Node.js, you can create child processes using the child_process module, which allows you to run separate Node.js instances or execute external programs.

Child processes can be used for various purposes, such as running blocking operations, utilizing multiple CPUs, or executing external programs that are not written in JavaScript.

In summary, threads are units of execution within a process, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks within the same memory space. Processes, on the other hand, are independent instances of a program with their own memory and resources. Node.js provides support for both threads and processes, with worker threads for parallel execution within a single program and child processes for running separate instances or external programs.

6)JWT structure payload?
ans:
A JWT (JSON Web Token) consists of three parts separated by dots (.): the header, the payload, and the signature. The structure of a JWT is as follows:

<header>.<payload>.<signature>

The token consists of three parts separated by dots (.):

Header (encoded):
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9

Decoded:
{
"alg": "HS256",
"typ": "JWT"
}

The header specifies the algorithm used for the signature, which is HMAC-SHA256 in this example.

Payload (encoded):
eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9

Decoded:
{
"sub": "1234567890",
"name": "John Doe",
"admin": true
}

The payload contains claims, such as the subject ("sub"), name ("name"), and admin status ("admin"). These claims provide information about the entity associated with the token.

Signature (encoded):
2jQ-LVG3yP8mXssDmHSatfBskv8hgyvNjvj_kEMu4v0

The signature is generated by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret key using the specified algorithm. The signature ensures the integrity of the token and verifies that it has not been tampered with.

So, the complete JWT structure is:
Header: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
Payload: eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9
Signature: 2jQ-LVG3yP8mXssDmHSatfBskv8hgyvNjvj_kEMu4v0

When using the JWT, the client sends the complete token in the authorization header or another suitable location to authenticate and authorize requests to a server or API. The server can verify the token's authenticity by decoding and verifying the signature using the shared secret key.


7)Duplex and transform stream?
Node.js, Duplex and Transform streams are two types of streams that can be used for data processing and manipulation. While they share some similarities, they have different purposes and behaviors. Let's take a closer look at each of them:



Duplex Stream:



A Duplex stream is a type of stream that can be both readable and writable.

It allows data to flow in both directions, meaning you can both read from and write to a Duplex stream.

Examples of Duplex streams in Node.js include TCP sockets and the net.Socket class.

Duplex streams are commonly used for scenarios where you need bidirectional communication, such as networking protocols or file system operations.

Transform Stream:



A Transform stream is a type of Duplex stream that provides an additional feature: data transformation.

It takes input data, performs some transformations on it, and produces the transformed data as output.

Transform streams implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces, so they can be used as both input and output for other streams.

Examples of Transform streams in Node.js include zlib.createGzip() for compressing data and crypto.createCipher() for encrypting data.

Transform streams are useful when you need to modify or process data as it passes through the stream, such as data compression, encryption, or parsing.

In summary, Duplex streams allow bidirectional data flow, while Transform streams are a specialized type of Duplex streams that focus on data transformation. Duplex streams are typically used for communication purposes, while Transform streams are used for data manipulation during streaming operations.


8)Spawn vs fork?
Ans:
spawn:

The spawn method launches a new process to execute a command.
It allows you to execute external commands and run them asynchronously.
The child process created by spawn does not have a direct connection to the parent process other than the standard input/output streams.
You can communicate with the child process by reading from its stdout and stderr streams or writing to its stdin stream.
The child process created with spawn runs in a separate V8 instance, meaning it has its own JavaScript runtime environment.
fork:

The fork method creates a new Node.js process and runs a JavaScript module in that process.
It is specifically designed for running separate instances of Node.js, enabling inter-process communication (IPC) between the parent and child processes.
The child process created by fork shares the same Node.js environment and global objects (such as process and console) with the parent process.
You can communicate between the parent and child processes using a messaging channel, allowing them to exchange messages.
The child process created with fork also runs in a separate V8 instance, but it shares the same Node.js runtime as the parent process.
To summarize, spawn is used for executing external commands and running them as separate processes, while fork is used for creating separate Node.js instances with shared environment and communication channels. Both spawn and fork create child processes that run in their own V8 instances.

9)Package.json vs Package lock.json?
ans:
In summary, while package.json is used for specifying the project's dependencies 
and their version ranges, package-lock.json is automatically generated to 
lock down the exact versions of these dependencies, ensuring consistency 
across different development environments and deployments. 
It is recommended to commit both files to version control 
to maintain consistent builds and avoid version conflicts in the future.

10)CommonJs?
Ans:
n the context of Node.js and JavaScript, a module system
 refers to a set of rules 
and conventions that allow developers to organize 
and manage code in a modular way. A modular approach means 
breaking down a large application into smaller, self-contained, 
and reusable units of code, called modules. Each module encapsulates 
specific functionality and can be imported and used in other parts 
of the application.

CommonJS is one of the module systems used in Node.js,
 and it was designed to address the challenges of organizing 
 code in large applications. 
CommonJS modules are designed with the goal of achieving 
code reuse, encapsulation, and dependency management.

Module Definition: Each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module. In CommonJS, you define a module using the module.exports object or by directly assigning to exports. For example:

js
Copy code
// math.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

module.exports = {
  add,
  subtract,
};
Module Import: To use functionality from other modules, you use the require function. This function allows you to import the exported features from other modules into your current module.

js
Copy code
// main.js
const math = require('./math');

console.log(math.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(math.subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2
Synchronous Loading: The require function in CommonJS is synchronous, meaning it blocks further execution until the required module is fully loaded and available. This synchronous nature can sometimes lead to performance issues when dealing with large applications.

Caching: CommonJS modules are cached after the first time they are loaded. This means that subsequent calls to require for the same module will return the same instance, avoiding duplicate module execution and improving performance.

CommonJS was an essential module system for Node.js in its earlier versions. However, with the advent of ECMAScript modules (ES modules) in modern versions of Node.js and browsers, developers now have an alternative and more standardized way of organizing code using import and export statements, which are part of the ES6+ specifications.

While CommonJS modules are still widely used, especially in existing Node.js codebases, ES modules offer some advantages, such as asynchronous loading and better compatibility with front-end JavaScript code. Nonetheless, both module systems continue to coexist and serve their respective purposes in the Node.js ecosystem.



11)semantic versioning rules nodejs?
ans:
~ locks major and minor numbers. 
It is used when you're ready to accept only bug-fixes (increments in the third number), 
but don't want any other changes, not even minor upgrades that add features.

^ locks the major number only. 
It is used when you are willing to receive bug fixes (increments in the third number) 
and minor upgrades that add features but should not break existing code (increments in the second number).

Yes, you are correct. When you run npm install or npm i in a Node.js project, npm will read the package.json file to determine the dependencies required for the project. However, it will not rely solely on the version ranges specified in the package.json. Instead, npm will use the information from the package-lock.json file (if it exists) to install the exact versions of the dependencies and their sub-dependencies.

The package-lock.json serves as a lockfile and contains the specific versions and resolved URLs of all the dependencies installed in the node_modules directory when npm install or npm ci was last executed. By having these exact versions listed in the package-lock.json, npm ensures that the same versions are installed consistently across different environments and by different developers working on the project.
Here's how the process works:

When you run npm install or npm i, npm looks for a package-lock.json file in the project directory.

If the package-lock.json file exists, npm uses it to determine the exact versions of dependencies to install.

If the package-lock.json file is missing or outdated (for example, if there are newer versions of the packages available), npm will use the version ranges specified in the package.json file and update the package-lock.json with the resolved versions.
